Create a new branch of the form <first name> "-" <last name> using the command git checkout -b <branch name> to create and shift to your own branch.       example- git checkout -b abhishek-malakar
All commits must be descriptive of what has been committed to the branch currently, use the convention task # : desciption.       example- Task 1 : Added new route give reply
after every major change to your code perform the following steps
git pull origin <branch name> should not be required as you will be working individually on your own branches, but do it anyway.
git add . this adds all your work to the staging area.
git commit -m "message" creates a local commit of your changes.
git push origin <branch name> makes the changes permanent on the remote repo.
All tasks will be uploaded here and on the group.
